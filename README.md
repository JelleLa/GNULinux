# GNU+Linux dotfiles üêß

This repository contains all my GNU+Linux configuration files. All the code is available under the "Unlicense" license. The only exception are the files in `/.icons` and `.themes` since these are GTK Themes (shell, icons, cursor) I collected and *not* made by me!

Currently the distribution of choice is NixOS, so everything is optimised for that.
